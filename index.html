        <h3>HPP Overview</h3>

        <p>Do you need to accept payments on your website? This seemingly simple task can quickly feel overwhelming when
            you begin exploring the various options for accepting online payments. Then, when you consider the
            complexity of security and the increased number of data breaches over the years, it’s clear that small
            businesses need to take precautions so they don’t risk being the next headline for a data breach.
        </p>

        <p>
            You have a simple need: you want to accept payments on your website. Clearent provides businesses and
            organizations various methods of accepting payments and donations to help them scale and grow. Our newest
            method, a payment button and hosted payment page, may be exactly what your company needs to get started with
            accepting online payments.

        </p>


        <h3>How it works</h3>

        <p>The Clearent payment button allows businesses to add a payment option to their website by simply copying and
            pasting a few lines of code into their existing website. From there, the rest of the payment experience is
            hosted by Clearent.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li> Add the payment button code to your webpage (<a href="examples.html">See our examples.</a>)</li>
            <img src="images/paynow.png"/>
            <li> When a customer or donor visits your website and clicks on the payment button, a modal window pops up with a payment form hosted by Clearent.
            </li>
            <br>

            <p><img src="images/example1.png"/></p>
            <li> The customer or donor enters their payment information.</li>
            <li> They click the submit button.</li>
            <li> Clearent processes the transaction.</li>
            <li> Clearent sends the browser a transaction response.</li>
        </ol>
